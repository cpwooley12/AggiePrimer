# Return of the King

Some in the SEC would claim that football season begins with SEC Media days, but it aint football season
until The Aggie Football Primer is released! After compiling numerous secret tapes of practice, hundreds
of hours on message boards, and personal drone footage conducted from an unnamed location in BCS,
here it is.

Return of the king...Last season we saw our NY6/playoff hopes go down in a heap when, skin and bones
but runs like the wind, Haynes King was tossed around like a rag doll by some 2star defensive lineman
from Colorado. Going into this offseason the talk around the program was what was going to happen at
QB with Maximum Johnson transferring in from LSU. For weeks, months after the spring game much
were convinced Max had the starting job after a dismal performance by Haynes. Entering fall camp Max
was definitely the leader for the job, but ask Scottie Scheffler how quickly things can change before you
get back to the clubhouse.

From all reports, Max was steady eddy during camp, still holding on to the ball too long (happens when
trying to learn a new offense) but not turning the ball over. Around the second scrimmage is when it all
changed, the word coming out of that scrimmage was high praise for Haynes, limited turnovers, moving
the ball downfield, commanding the offense and adjusting protections like a 3rd year man should.
However, what has plagued Haynes his whole career here was been inconsistency, after reading and
talking to people about the scrimmage I still remained a skeptic as did many others. Alas, throughout the
remaining weeks of camp the kid never seemed to waver, even as Weigman began to get comfortable
and flashed Haynes punched back and won the job. So the king has returned for year two, lets say our
prayers that his hollow bird bones have healed because with him healthy this offense has been fast and
dynamic in practice/scrimmages.

## The Offense

At the time of writing this, the head ball coach has still not released a depth chart, admittingly he has
noted several position battles that are somewhat undecided (in a good way and you'll see why).

My projection of the starting 11 goes as such.

QB - King
RB - Achane
WR X - Stewart
WR Y - Smith
WR Z - Lane
TE - Wright
LT - Zuhn
LG - Ogunbiyi
C - Wycoff OR Foster
RG - Robinson


RT - Fatheree

### Quarterback

Haynes is about the same size as he was last year, maybe a few lbs. bigger, but any worries about losing
some of his speed after breaking his ankle have been quelled. Practice reports spoke of Haynes' ability
to get to the edge against our 1s on defense which is not slow by any means. His passing has improved
some but ultimately that was not what won him the job, his passing was on par with Max and Conner,
however Jimbo loved the idea of Haynes, Achane, Anias and the freshman Stewart on the field at once.
The debate seems to be when Weigman comes off the bench, Jimbo is not afraid of putting him out
there in the case of a mid-late season injury. Kid can ball. Max... well, he’s the solid Mond type backup
that would be called on to lead the troops if we have a remake of last season.

Bottom line is, the offense with Haynes has the potential to be lethal, Haynes seems to have improved
enough to make that happen, we just won’t know until the lights come on.

### Running Back

This position group is headlined by Devon Achane, the speedster averaged 7 YPC on 130+ carries and 9
TDs last season while behind Isaiah Spiller who is now the spell back for Austin Eckler and the LA
Chargers. Achane is not only a threat in the run game but in the passing attack as well, catching 24
passes with an average of 11yds/catch. All reports were he had the best camp of any player on the
roster, his speed, balance, and vision have been showcased all camp and will be used much more
frequently catching passes out of the backfield.

Behind him are two backs that host a dichotomy of skill sets, Amari Daniels out of Florida and LJ
Johnson from Cypress, Texas. Lj is a bigger, more powerful back that is a one cut runner, while Daniels is
much better in space and hard to bring down with his quickness. The battle for the backup RB should be
interesting to watch unfold during the season. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see the 2022 signee
LeVeon Moss burst onto the scene, he's a powerful and explosive runner that needs to improve in pass
protection to see more PT.

#### TLDR;

If Achane doesn’t get the ball 20 times a game (Ole Miss 2021), Jimbo's prized heifer needs to be
publicly castrated at midfield.

### Receiver

Coach Coley moving over from the TE's has helped tremendously, his emphasis on route running and
creating space to get open has paid dividends throughout camp. One less talked about part of camp that
was evident on film was Anias Smith has had the best camp of his career at A&M, catching everything
and making his presence known early and often.

The trio of Stewart, Thomas and Marshall are the future stars on offense at A&M. Stewart is just that
much better, in fact, he’s that much better than every receiver on the roster. He will be starting week 1
and will get his touches. Chase Lane came into camp knowing his job was in jeopardy and has benefited


the most from the coaching change. Lane has sharpened his route running and is getting space more
frequently. I wouldn’t say he’s due to "break out" by any mean but his knowledge of the offense and
improvement is what has kept the other 2 much more talented freshman off the field.

The receiver rotation will be greatly expanded from years past (not saying much) and this position will
be another one to watch as the season wanes and the players mature.

### Tight Ends

Max Wright is just a better blocker and knows the offense better than any of the freshman Tight Ends.
This position group should get a ton of use this season with some 12 personnel mixed in, in Fisher's
offense, an emphasis is placed on inline blocking and if you can’t, you won’t play. With that being said,
Donovan Green is said to be the leader of the freshman due to him being a bigger body that can block as
well as he can catch and run. Overall, it will be very interesting to watch how these guys progress
through the season, Wright, Green, Johnson, Smith can all play with the two freshman having the higher
ceilings both athletically and physically.

Final note on the TE's; Thor is much further along than expected and has shocked some with how fast he
is at his size. It would be hard to project him factoring in a ton this year, but the kid has monster
potential

### Offensive Line

Steve "Bunch a Guys Bein Dudes" Addazio was the perfect OL hire for this squad. His OL style reminds
me of a Marshawn Lynch clip "when you run through a motherfucker's face over and over and over and
over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over". He’s
one of the best OL coaches in the country and will have a group of 5 men war ready this season. Its
tough to see what’s happening on film through Addazio's dip filled spit flying through the air and from
an iPhone tucked into the goal post padding but from what I could tell this is how the OL will go this
season.

LT Fatheree is the best player on both lines, and it’s not really close, the guy will make millions in a few
years. RG, Layden Robinson is a guy made from Addazio's own heart, the big guy mauls people in the run
game. He’s a first off the bus, biting heads off live bats kind of imposing figure. LT will be the RS Fr. Trey
Zuhn, a very talented kid who is best in pass pro, he seemed to struggle with power, so I expect a lot of
formations favoring the left side with a TE/RB/HB against more physically imposing DE's. LG will be Aki
Ogunbiyi, the onetime prized recruit has yet to live up to expectations in Aggieland. His weight and the
staff's plan for his has been one contributing factor in that. Coming in at 340, cutting down to 295 but
now he finally settles in as a JR at 6'3.5" and 320lbs, I’m looking for him to play much more consistent in
all facets of the game.

Here's where it gets interesting; Bryce Foster started every game last season at C and was never
questioned. The 2021 Freshman All American decided to take some time off late in the summer to finish
preparing for the T&F World Championships and then needed a week to rest and get back into football.
This time out opened the door for Jr. Matthew Wykoff who has played extremely well and is about neck


and neck with Foster. For the opener I expect Wykoff to be the guy who starts the game, but that is
subject to change going past week 1.

## Durkin's Defense

With the departure of Mike Elko who turned one of the worst defenses in the SEC in 2017, ranked 87th
in scoring defense into a top 5 unit last season. Elko's foundation on containing the run game and
making the QBs throw into tight windows worked very well to get us out of the gutter defensively.

Incomes the new guy, DJ Durkin, made his name at Florida and Michigan playing aggressively and
generating big plays on defense. Boy oh boy does he have the horses in the barn to do just that this
year. Our speed on the field is noticeable with the All-American roaming around, and 26 looking locked
in to have a stellar senior campaign.

#### A few notes from practice on scheme:

Durkin primarily ran a 3 man front at ole miss last year, that was mostly due to lack of personnel. That
will not be a factor in College Station, and Durkin himself has noted that our scheme will be multiple.

Look for us to run a 3- 3 - 5 against heavy passing teams like Miss St, and Ole Miss. Our smaller and
rangier DE', Enai White, Malik Sylla, have been practicing at stand-up LB in that 3- 3 - 5 scheme. Another
wrinkle has been a 1 high look with Gilbert or Matthews as the high safety. In this look Demani is
inserted into a rover role much like Antonio Johnson, see ball, get ball. What an unsettling sight for
offenses to see 26 and 27 roaming around the big boys up front like Mac Jack, Turner, Adeleye, Lucas
and Overton. Finally, our CB play will change, Elko like to run a lot of Cover 3/drop coverage with the
CBs off the line. Durkin is changing that mindset (probably bc he knows he has the speed on the back
end to do so), our Corners will be playing a lot more physical at the LOS compared to previous years.

WDE - Diggs
SDE - Adeleye
NT - Jackson
3 Tech- Turner/Raikes
Mike - White/Russell
Will - Cooper
NB - Johnson
CB 1 - J Jones/George
CB 2 - Chappell/M Jones
SS - Richardson
FS - Gilbert/Matthews

### Defensive Line

Well, we needed to replace all 4 starters from last season, and so we went scorched earth on the
recruiting trail and made ol' Saint Nick go crying to his boosters. What’s even more wild than last year’s
DL class, I don’t expect any of them to start. That isn’t due to them under preforming either, the front 4
guys we have now are just better than the freshman. Diggs has reportedly been dominant off the edge
(caveat, Zuhn was out for the first scrimmage when Diggs took it over), Raikes has benefited from the


influx of talent pushing the former 3 star, becoming an anchor in the middle. I do expect Turner to start
and continue to start over Raikes but damn is it good to have depth.

Anthony Lucas has been by far the best freshman and will be the first one off the bench, but not far
behind him is a kid who is supposed to still be in high school, LT Overton. The former '22 No.1 overall
recruit reclassified last year and enrolled in Aggieland this past summer and the 17 - year-old began
whipping the 2nd team OL. With all of the hype that Shemar Stewart, Nolen, and Dindy had coming in I
don’t want to come off like these guys have disappeared at all. They have just all battled their share of
knicks and bangs and will continue to get better as the season progresses.

### Linebacker

Edge Cooper is my bold prediction of the preseason; he will be an All American behind this defensive
line. An absolute monster in fall camp going sideline to sideline. The question in this group will be who
takes a hold of the MIKE job? Andre White is the incumbent starter but has struggled in run fits in
previous years, but until now no one has challenged him since the loss of Buddy. His challenger this year
is Chris Russell who has taken the opening left when White went out early in camp, and much like
Wykoff, hasn’t relinquished it. This is a thin group this season with two promising freshman and veteran
Tarian Lee on the bench. We must stay healthy at this spot and if we get solid Mike play...watch out

### Defensive Back

Demani Richardson is who you want on that wall, who you need on that wall. The senior safety has been
displaying his athleticism and experience all camp, looking for a big year from him.

At Corner, it’s crazy to even type this but man are we deep here! Both incumbent starters are back, and
Myles Jones was returning to his 2020 form before tweaking an ankle. Add in Brian George excelling in
press coverage and Denver Harris lurking for an opportunity, this group should be stout all the way
down to though the second string.

Saftey opposite of Richardson was a spot, that after spring you thought was all but wrapped up.
Sophomore Jardin Gilbert out of Louisiana showed great range and willingness to get involved in the run
game. However, as camp progressed, we started hearing little birdies singing the song of Freshman
Jacoby Matthews (also out of Louisiana). The former 5 star is still catching up with the defensive
scheme, but man has he been making plays. I think Gilbert starts but they both will get time, then let the
best man win!

This team has been impressive in practice and scrimmages with plays being made on both sides of the
ball, Jimbo knows it and has been talking that talk this offseason. We are good QB play and health at LB
away from making a run, does that happen this year? Only time will tell, regardless we have a very good
and deep squad that will impose their will on teams with the goal of mentally breaking them.
