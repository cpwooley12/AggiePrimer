# Feed the Studs

Another year of aggie football is upon us and I for one could not wait for the season to get here. Back in the early spring the tensions in Bright were high, a talented team fell embarrasingly short of expectations and in the head man's 5th season, the result was unacceptable. So much so rumors of buying out Jimbo Fisher's contract and sending him backon those country roads(hes from WV). 

In 2022 we saw the epitome of 2010s-style college football crash and burn on the national stage. Between Jimbo's waffle house menu playbook, zero effort spent in the transfer portal despite numerous holes in the roster, a complex and meticulous way of playing football and even worse, an antiquated philosophy in running a college football program with the head man running everything himself. The fact is, Jimbo was completely embarassed in 2022. For two years he proclaimed to the media and boosters alike, "Haynes King is the guy", even when the on field results suggested different. Jimbo has been given everything hes needed to succeed here, resources, decision making authroity at the program level and full support of the aggie fan base. Although Texas A&M is recruiting at the highest level in its history, the results on the field resemble the Haynes King profectics of recent years. The simple truth is, the way he learned to run a program from Bobby Bowden is dead. 


Feed the studs! - After dragging Jimbo behind the cart a bit its time to give credit where credit is due. Whether forced, coerced or of his own accord, Jimbo went out and hired an offensive coordinator to take over the offense. Relegating the responsibilities that got him where he is today is no small ordeal, and regardless of what you may have heard, since the moment Bobby P has entered the building, he has been in completed control of the offense.

Last season was an abboration in many aspects; we had the worst schedule all of DI college football in 2022 (didnt play a home conference game until halloween), the injury bug (40 games missed from 20 starters) and youth (due to injury we started 30 freshman). All of which will be different (at least injury wise going into game 1) with the 2023 campaign. 

### Youth
Instead of being the least experienced team in the SEC, A&M returns 80% of their productivity from last year, quickly becoming one of the most experienced team in the league. On the DL all 12 of the 3 deep return, 2 LBs, 6 of the 2 deep in the defensive backfield, and 7 returning starters on offense including the QB.

### Schedule
Gathering momentum early in the season is crucial for a younger team to gain confidence, play with rythum and ultimately win games when the weather turns cold. In 2022 a team of 18 year olds with 3 different QBs didnt get that luxury until October 29th (where weigman went 28/44 338yds 4TD 0INT). When Auburn comes to town in late September, this will be a drastically different SEC football team than 2022. 

### Offense
Gone are the days of burning timeouts on offense because we cant get into the right personnel, gone are the days of witnessing Jimbo fumble through 75 play sheets trying to draw up the perfect play only to snap the ball as the play clock expires. Gone are the days of failing to complete a forward pass because "we just didnt execute". This unit is poised to 180 the results witnessed a season ago.


Now before I jump into predictions and my analysis of this team on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, lets go over the projected depth chart for Week 1 


## Depth Chart

### Offense

#### Quarterback:

* #15 Conner Weigman 6'3" 215
* #14 Max Johnson 6'6" 230
* hopefully QB3 doesnt come into play (Marcel Reed or the Fresno St. transfer)

#### Running Back

The competition in the backfield has been fierce in camp, Amari Daniels looked good spelling Achane a season ago but Im not sure if he can hold off the talent the other two backs possess. Leveon Moss is the most complete back in the stable, runs with power and vision combined with enough burst to be a homerun hitter. However he tends to run upright which may work if youre Derek Henry but his 210lb frame has tended to get dinged up and miss time on the field. Rueben Owens, the five star true freshman has garnered immense praise in fall camp. His skill set and running style is akin to the likes of Mike Goodson, A&M circa 2008 or his recruiting comparison, Reggie Bush - although Im not ready to make THAT leap just yet.  What will keep the former #1 HS RB in the nation off the field will be pass protection, there will be added emphasis this season on keep Weigman upright and healthy so I expect to see a lot of 2 TE or 2 RB sets early in the season. 

* #4 Amari Daniels
* #8 Leveon Moss
* #2 Rueben Owens


#### Wide Reciever

This is the group I believe will make the largest jump from the previous seasons under Jimbo, in years prior this group lacked speed and consistency (what did Kendrick Rogers do save 2 games?). When the ags line it up this season, we will be athletically superior at WR to any team we play this year with the exception of the usual suspects, Alabama and LSU. Headlining the group, Evan Stewart has gone from a flashy talented freshman to a guy who is regularly unguardable. The speed shows, the hands show but his route running might be the best in the country at the collegiate level, looking for him to go for +1000yds. Noah Thomas has struggled to stay healthy as a freshman, but so did half the team last year, the 6'6" 200lb sophomore has legit 4'4" speed and has been the downfield threat we briefly saw from Caleb Chapman during the 2020 florida game and Josh Reynolds during the Sumlin years. The slot is Moose's domain, how the hell did this guy not play the last several years???? Moose the hybrid between Anais (more of a stockier RB/Deebo) and Evan (great ball skills, hands and speed), I still cannot understand how we kept this guy behind Chase Lane. Anais Smith rounds out the starters (depending on personnel) of this group but will primarily be used as a multi purpose athlete. Smith will return punts, play slot as well as some RB this season but its unclear what his snap share will be given the 3 listed above him.

* #1 Evan Stewart 6' 175
* #4 Noah Thomas 6'6" 210
* #7 Moose Muhammad 6'1" 205

* #0 Anias Smith 5'10" 200


#### Tight End

The group that sustained the only major injury on the roster might be the only group that could withstand the hit and not skip a beat. Former #1 HS TE in the nation Jake Johnson and the Sweedish Hammer Theo Melin Ohrstrom with a little (or a lot depending on gameplan) Max Wright will be the names youll see most at least early in the year. Jake is more of a pure receiveing threat from the TE position (think Sternberger) while Max is the blocking TE due to his size. Theo is the wildcard, the Sweede has only played football for a handfull of years but stands at 6'6" 250lbs running 4.6, measureables alone are eye popping but can he play football? Word from fall camp has been a tenative yes, I will never take Jimbo at face value again but he has raved about Theo's play during camp.

* #19 Jake Johnson 6'6" 240
* #11 Theo Melin Ohrstrom 6'6" 250
* #42 Max Wright 6'4" 260


Others to watch:

* #82 Fernando Garza 6'6" 250lb Sophomore
* #6 Jaden Platt 6'5" 245lb Freshman 

This group is talented and very deep, we will miss Donovan Green but if theres any position group on campus that could handle losing its starter it would be TE


#### Offensive Line

Saved the best for.... well, Im just listing them last. 

This group was downright awful in 2022, got 2 QBs injured and couldnt stop a cold. I still have nightmares of App st. defensive linemen running over Matthew Wykoff en route to another TFL.

Where Im concerned this year with the OL may suprise some, but the Center position is very shaky going into game one. Either Jimbo is playing 4D chess not giving up how healthy or committed Bryce Foster, Bryce is actually injured still or he just hasnt committed to getting ready for football season after transitioning from track and field. Theres lots of rumors and speculation surrounding the 2021 freshman all-american center, I have no clue what to expect and it gives me heartburn.

Tackle is going to be an interesting position to watch, there are 4 viable guys to insert at either spot; Duece Fatheree, Trey Zuhn, Chase Bisontis and Dametrious Crownover. Crownover has been developing as an OL since transitioning from TE in highschool. He was very raw when he got to campus but his prototypical NFL LT size is undenyable, standing at 6'7" 315lbs. He probably needs another year to become the started imagined coming out of highschool but will be servicable backup tackle this season. Chase Bisontis was the gatorade player of the year in the state of New Jersey when the 6'5" 320lb offensive lineman chose the Ags. From day one on campus he has battled for a starting role while Fatheree recovers from offseason surgery, look for the preseason freshman all-american to start week 1 with Duece out. Duece is still working his way back from surgery and will be out week one, hes practiced most of camp but is going to be worked back into game speed. Trey Zuhn, from the stands, fucking sucked last year. What we did not know is that he was playing through a torn labrum and a dislocated knee cap all season. As the real story of 2022 Zuhn comes out all I can wish for is to stay healthy so he can play to his potential, hes shown hes tough, now can he show that he can block the rush ends coming off the edge in the SEC? 50/50 


This OL unit is full or road graders up front, running the ball should be available in all 12 games but can we get better pass protection than last year? Its been their stated emphasis all offseason but I still expect a lot of 2 back or 2 TE sets early to help chip and blitz pickup early in the season until the unit settles in.



* LT - #60 Trey Zuhn 6'7" 315 - #89 Dametrious Crownover 6'7" 315
* LG - #75 Kam Dewberry 6'4" 330 - #66 Jordan Spasojevic Moko 6'5" 340
* C -  #61 Bryce Foster 6'5" 330 - #54 Mark Nabou 6'4" 325 R-FR
* RG - #64 Layden Robinson 6'4" 315 - #67 TJ Shanahan 6'4" 325 FR
* RT - #71 Chase Bisontis 6'5" 320 - #76 Rueben Fatheree 6'8" 315

*Note: Although I put Crownover at backup LT, if Zuhn goes down I expect Fatheree to slide to LT and Bisontis to take RT back*



### Defense

#### Defensive Line

Ill get more into this in the predictions later but if this team is going to make a leap to 9-11 wins this year, this unit has to play to their ranking, and I think they will. Theres just too much talent on this unit. The 2 deep has three 4star and five 5star guys, some of the most sought after talent on the DL the past two years has made its way to College Station and its only a matter of time before they play like it. Last season we struggled to get a consistent pass rush, both because of injury and youth. Fadil Diggs was injured last season only appearing in 5 games and finishing 3 of them, yet he had a sack in each game he fully played (2 against Bama). LT Overton, in my eyes is the future at the position for the Ags, coming in last year at 17yrs old (he graduated a year early) showed flashes but was just not ready for the physicality of the SEC. Overton has slimmed down to 255 from 265 last year and looks to have added some additional burst off the LOS that combined with his size/strength/agility should make him a viable pass rush option for the ags in 2023 and beyond. 

There are two players that played the hybrid LB role in Durkin's dipshit 3-3-5 scheme last season, Enai White and Malick Sylla, both have a change to flash with their ahtleticism.


Moving inside is where it gets interesting, Walter Nolen has lost weight hoping to provide a little more wiggle out his 3tech poistion. I think he is at his best when he plays with speed on the interior, his all american attribute is his pop off the snap, that paired with a little more agility might be the winning recepie for the former #1 recruit in the country. The 5 tech is dominated by the Shemar's; Turner and Stewart, Turner is a bulky 5 tech and 10lbs heavier than Nolen now. The added size and his maturity should allow for him to set the edge in run D (for a defense that was 123rd last year in rushing defense anything would better). I could go on for hours here typing up hype pieces for each player on the DL bc they just are flat that talented, but like I mentioned earlier, they have to play like it. 



* WDE  - #10 Fadil Diggs 6'5" 260/ #18 LT Overton 6'5" 255
* 3T   - #0 Walter Nolen 6'4" 285/ #99 Gabriel Brownlow-Dindy 6'3" 290 / #17 Albert Regis 6'2" 325
* Nose - #3 Mckinley Jackson 6'2" 325  / #34 Isaih Raikes 6'2" 320
* SDE  - #5 Shemar Turner 6'4" 295 / #4 Shemar Stewart 6'6" 285



#### Linebacker

Big shake up in the projected starting line up from the spring, true freshman Taurean York arrived back in August at 230lbs, up from 215 in highschool. As under recruited as he was in highschool, York finished his career as a 3x Defensive District MVP while racking up 435 tkls, 47 tfl, 15 sacks, 11ffumb. The kid was a big time player in a 6A district in Temple, Texas but was viewed slightly undersized - ala Nick Bolton a few years back that became an All-American and a Super Bowl champion with the Chiefs - and so the Ags were able to regroup late after missing on Ant Hill.  Opposite York at WILL LB is veteran Edgerrin Cooper, hes a guy who you like in coverage and operating in space, not a guy that likes fighting off 300lbers so the DL keeping blocks off of the backers will be huge for Cooper's production. Linebacker as a whole struggled last year, having the 123rd ranked run defense, this position basdly missed out on Perkins and Hill the previous two cycles. This group has the potential to be good not great. 



* MLB - Taurean York / Christopher Russell / Jurriente Davis
* WLB - Edgerrin Cooper / Martrell Harris / Daymion Sanford 


#### Corner Back

AJ's replacemnt at nickle is probably better than AJ right now and might have been last year as well, Bryce Anderson is a fucking baller. 4.3 speed, can cover you like a blanket but loves to come up and hit in the box. Rare athelete that is the best player on our defense and an argument could be made for the best player on the team. He will be the replacement if a safety or a corner goes down this season as he plays either better than any of the backups. Stud. 

Cornerback, odd story, one spot is locked down by Tyreek Chappell but with some of the transfers this past spring the staff went out and got two former 5star guys as replacement. However as fall camp progressed thats not excatly what played out. Former all world 5star Tony Grimes (UNC transfer) was quickly passed by true freshman Jayvon Thomas and former 3star but multi year starter at Boston College, transfer Joshua DeBerry. Tony really struggles in coverage deep and got exposed by the A&M wideouts during camp. Good player just not someone you want on an island every play against Tennessee, Alabama, Ole Miss or LSU. DeBerry will be your starting corner opposite of Chappell, hes sticky in coverage and will come up and hit you as well, he will spell Bryce Anderson at NB if injuries happen at S.

As you can see we are pretty thin long term at corner and desparately need to land Kobe Black and more impact CB's in portal

* CB - #7 Tyreek Chappell 5'11 185 / #16 Sam McCall 6'1" 185
* CB - #28 Joshua DeBerry 6'1" 180 / #14 Jayvon Thomas 6' 190 / #8 Tony Grimes 6' 190

* NB - #1 Bryce Anderson 6' 195 / #25 Dalton Brooks 6' 200




#### Safety 

Demani is back at SS and will be the captain of the defense, getting everyone lined up, and the vocal leader. We know who he is, good in run protection but can be sus deep but also has had the propensity to make big plays his whole career, we win 3 games without him last year. Glad we got him to come back, although after last season im not sure what options were there for him. Demani will be subbed for superbly talented sophomore Jacoby Matthews who will take up the position mantle upon 26's departure follwoing this season. At the other safety spot, Jardin Gilbert has the starting role locked down initally. However last season Jared Kerr flashed so it would not suprise me if there was a healthy rotation at this spot.


The number 1 passing defense in the country returning all but 1 starter should be a pretty sweaty unit again in 2023, numbers wont be quite as high (hopefully) with an improved run defense. 

* SS - #26 Demani Richardson 6'1" 215 / #2 Jacoby Mathews 6'2" 215
* FS - #20 Jardin Gilbert 6'1" 200 / #33 Jared Kerr 6' 195




## Predictions


**FEED THE STUDS**
*"We talk about offensive philosophy, and I always say FTS, which is 'Feed The Studs', it's kind of the quarterbacks and the coaches need to understand how do we gxet the ball to our best guys."*


Last season we saw countless offensive possessions amount to 2yds if we are lucky and a pile of dust. It was that or maybe a flash play by Evan or Achane outrunning the entire defense. The offense looks stoneage, no movement, no concepts to allow easy completions to your atheletes in space (something we use to bitch at Spav about). Bobby Petrino essentially runs the same style of offense but with one major twist, timing doesnt dictate if your atheletes get the ball or not. If I had to go back and watch every Jimbo post game press conference and take a shot for everytime the work "execute" was said by the HBC, Id be dead. Jimbo relies heavily on timing in his plays to "scheme" guys open but in reality 19-22 year olds arent livign in the playbook, especially when they could transfer the next year. So the age of reciever and the QB having to read the coverage the same in unison to be able to complete a pass is over. Get the ball to the playmakers and put them in positions to make plays, we have the horses, let em run.

Offensive line is still a question mark but experience matters at that position probably the second most on the football field behind QB. We must stay healthy though, too many injuries derailed their chances of gelling during the season. That cannot happen this year, we need to recruit more OT's and hit the portal but in the meantime we have to stay healthy. And I think the staff knows it, which is why theres angst over Fatheree and Foster currently, they cannot be rushed back into game shape or they will be injured again. Health health health, most important storyline this season on the OL.

Ultimately when evaluating and predicting an offense's performance, it comes down to the signal caller, qb has to be good to win. Conner has looked very good this camp and the competition wasnt really that close, but that wont be said publicly. Keep him on his feet and I think you see a lot more of Ole Miss Weigman than Auburn Weigman. Keep him upright and he will be good, but for this team to be very good, he needs to be elite.

My honest opinion is, we are going to see an offense that plays well enough to win 80% of our games and our defense will keep us in most if not all of our games. This season is going to come down to, can we make the plays when it counts? eg; Not throwing the ball short of the goalline on the last play of the game, not taking 180 penalties in a season, not giving up 200yds on the ground each game, not allowing opposing QB's a moon cycle to throw the ball, not taking procedural penalties after timeouts. With Jimbo not calling plays, and the most talented recruiting class of all time a year older, having a QB that can win you games and wont lose them, yeah we can be very good but can we clean up the discipline and allow our the talent to play?


### Record Prediciton
