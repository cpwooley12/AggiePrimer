The 2019 Fightin Texas Aggie football season is here at last, with an offseason full of Texas and Texas
A&M recruiting banter, we finally get to put all the talk aside, strap it up between the lines and play
goddamn some football.

I am going to breakdown and separate Jimbo's upcoming sophomore season here in Aggieland into two
categories, things we know and questions to be answered. This team faces the gauntlet of SEC
scheduling this season with the addition of traveling to play the defending National Champs, the
Clemson Tigers. Two trips to Death Valley in one season would not be the most ideal way to draw up a
schedule. But hey, we're here, let's go beat those sombitches.

Let's begin with the things we know,

## The Facts

## The Interior D Line is Really Good

In the SEC you need size in the trenches to control games late and stop the run. The two deep on the
interior of the defensive line this year averages 6'4" and 304 pounds. To put that size into perspective,
Alabama's interior defensive line averages 6'4" and 306lbs, the days of starting 270 pound Spencer
Nealy at nose are over.

Not only do these maulers have SEC size but these mf'rs are flat out good. Justin Madubuike has been
named to 4 different defensive award watch lists coming off a stellar season with 10.5 TFL and 5.5 sacks.
His partner in crime and fellow starter, Bobby Brown, who came in as a nationally ranked top 100 player
and a top 15 D line prospect, flashed last year. This 325 pound beast will provide, at the very least, run
support akin to Daylon Mack of 2018. Brown is the guy you let off of the bus first, this man is a
behemoth with the athleticism of a player 50lbs lighter.

Both of those guys are backed up by Jordan Peevy and Josh Rodgers who both are expected to be
playmakers to fill out the two deep.

## Demani Richardson

You're going to want to remember this name for the foreseeable future. 6'1" 210lbs Demani Richardson
arrived on campus waves ahead the rest of the 2019 class. Sidelined during his senior season he saw
fellow aggie commit Brian Williams catapult to 5 star status while he was sort of became the forgotten
safety in the class. Well, a year later and Demani has not just flashed but shown the poise and maturity
of an upper classman. His play has been nothing but stellar. In Elko's Defense, Elko likes to puts pressure
on the offense by blitzing his rover backer from different slots leaving the safeties to not only play their
coverage responsibilities when but to provide support on the second read of the RPO. As you saw last
year Derrick Tucker really struggled with this aspect of the new defense and is now why Demani
Richardson will be starting game 1.

## The Receiving Corps is Deep and Experienced

Last season we all saw the importance, in this day and age, to have a reliable receiving corps following
the Mississippi State game. I swear Buckley forgot he had hands and Rodgers went full retard. However

the Mississippi State game. I swear Buckley forgot he had hands and Rodgers went full retard. However
coming into 2019 this group looks poised to not only replace the production lost via Jace Sternberger,
but to be a stand out group in the offense and here's a couple reason why this is fact.

Jimbo Fisher runs a traditional west coast offense that has evolved to incorporate the classic RPO action,
however that puts a tremendous stress on the receivers. Run the ball and get the ball downfield off of
play action, the pillars of a west coast scheme. When the qb takes the ball under center and takes a full
run action, his back is completely turned to the defense, this places the onus on the receivers to read
the coverage mid route and react accordingly. This cerebral aspect to the position in this offense makes
it difficult for young receivers in year one and takes their focus away from the receiving portion of their
position. In year two this will be lightyears better, plain and simple.

Secondly, the guy throwing them the ball will be better. Frankly the tight end is a safety blanket for an
average quarterback that may hide other issues. Last year Kellen struggled with throws high over the
middle and velocity outside of the hashes. Another year of development and Kellen will be vastly
different from last year. Now I am not saying that Kellen is going to be a world beater, however his
accuracy and command of the offense will allow guys like Kendrick Rodgers and Quartney Davis to make
more plays down the field.

As a whole the receiver room is buzzing with energy right now, Jhamon Ausbon came into camp 5-7 lbs
lighter and is getting in and out of his cuts. He's added some wiggle to his power possession receiver
game, and its shown in camp big time. Caleb Chapman, prior to an injury in camp sidelining him for his
freshman season, showed up on campus at 6'5" 215 running a laser 4.5 in the 40. He was only a 3 star
recruit mainly due to being a tall white receiver who played in a triple option offense. Chapman will give
us a downfield threat this year. Accompanying him in the two deep at receiver we have the 2018
Gatorade Player of the Year Jalen Preston out of Manvel, Texas. Go look at his high school film, this guy
is a football guy.

### The Offensive Line will be Solid

This group here, no they don’t compare to the 2012 group with Joekel, Matthews, Ogbuehi and ifedi,
but they have 3 years of experience. The only moving part is a 5 star youngin who is already the second
or third best lineman we have, Kenyon Green. When they released the depth chart Aggie faithful let out
an enormous sigh of relief when Colton Prater was not listed as the starting center. I still have flashbacks
to his getting put on skates and just flat out manhandled by Bama a couple of years ago. ANYWAYS, lets
unpack this group.

Left Tackle: Dan Moore, the 6'5" 325 pound dancing bear, by far our best offensive lineman. He has the
length, the athleticism, and experience to protect Kellen's blindside. Hes not the best offensive lineman
in the country where he would shut down Raekwon Davis for 60 minutes but he's a very solid left tackle

Left Guard: Jared Hocker, 6'5" 315 pounder from North Richland Hills, Texas and has developed into a
bulldozer at left guard. Go back and watch the film of last year, Travyeon got drafted running behind
Hocker and Moore on the left side. This should only improve going into the 2019 season

Center: Ryan McCollum, yes we did lose Erik McCoy and yes McCoy is probably going to be a game 1
starter for the saints at center this season. However we may not have replaced him with a guy as big
but, McCollum knows the offense, three years into his collegiate career, second year in the system. In
this offense it is more important to have a center who knows how to set the protections, and set the run
game and that’s what McCollum brings to the table

Right Guard: The number one offensive lineman recruit in the country, consensus All-American, 5 star,
Kenyon Green. True Freshman coming in at 6'4" 330lbs. Next.


Right Tackle: Carson Green, 6'6" 315, Junior from Southlake, Texas. This rich kid has received
professional training since he was 5, and it shows. If he isn't the second best offensive lineman in this
group then its just because Kenyon is that good.

Solid fucking group if we can stay healthy and keep Prater on the sidelines.

## Questions to be Answered

### Where's the pass rush coming from?

The secondary will be better, but the best way to cover up a decent secondary is to get to the
quarterback. Who's going to provide the pressure this year? No clue, and to be honest that’s a fault of
our own, we struck out on numerous WDE recruits since Myles. Landis Durham with the 2017 season
gave us a flash by leading the SEC in sacks but last year we gave quarterbacks days to throw. This has to
change, in a hurry. I have heard great things about Michael Clemons at SDE, he's 6'5" 275lbs and
chiseled but he hasn’t played a meaningful down in nearly 2 years. How is he going to hold up
physically?

Next is DeMarvin Leal, 5 star defensive end out of San Antonio. In the Army All American bowl last year
Leal routinely whipped every 5 star tackle he faced. As an early enrollee he participated in the spring
and subsequently went down with a knee injury that sidelined him until fall. At the moment he is
adjusting to regaining his strength in that leg. So yeah he could become an x factor as the season
progresses but at this point, add another tally to the question mark column.

Finally there's the group that includes the Tyree's, Johnson and Wilson, joined by Max Wright. Frankly I
do not see Max as a WDE he is just does not have the bend to turn the corner that you would like to see
in a pass rusher. That doesn’t mean he won't contribute, I just don’t see it off the edge. Now with the
Tyree's, to be honest I haven't heard anything, which either means Jimbo is keeping tight lips about their
play, or they are just trash.

This group has potential to be good enough but frankly we will have to bring 5-6 to get pressure on the
likes of UGA, Bama and Clemson. Which will put pressure on the secondary who has Charles Oliver
starting right now..... So there's that.

### Can the Linebackers Stay Healthy

Mike Elko's scheme doesn’t really rely on funneling everything to the Mike backer to make every play
and likes to sit in a 4- 2 - 5 instead of his supposed base of a 4-3. In this scheme you don’t need a 6- 7
linebacker rotation, if you can stay healthy. We do not have 6-7 serviceable linebackers right now on the
roster, however the top line is talented.
Anthony Hines was the number 2 inside linebacker in the country coming out of high school and has
played very well, when he's not in the training room. Buddy Johnson, another 4 star linebacker recruit
from Dallas, Texas, at 6'2" 230 he has turned himself into the modern day Mike backer. However he too
has been plagued with injuries during his career. This top line of linebackers could be really special if
they stay on the field for the entirety of the season.

Filling out the two deep at Mike and Sam respectively, are Andre White Jr and Aaron Hansford. Let's
start with the former wideout turned backer. Coming out of high school he was a top 150 player at
linebacker but narrowed his college choices when he announced he wouldn’t play linebacker in college.
Stumblin Sumlin was able to snatch him away from the DC area for that reason. After two injury riddled
seasons at receiver, Jimbo & Co. convinced the former 4 star linebacker to return to the position. At 6'3"
228 and the physical maturity of a college junior he is the best athlete in the linebacker room. Then


228 and the physical maturity of a college junior he is the best athlete in the linebacker room. Then
there is Andre White jr, true freshman from Pennsylvania who flipped to us from Penn State early in his
recruitment and held fast with the decision to come to Aggieland. At 6'3" 225 he's physically up to the
task. This kid was a tackling machine in high school, racking up 135 TOT his senior year and named the
State's best player.

This group is very good at the top but after you name those 4, we get to guys like, and God forbid we
have another 12th man playing linebacker for us again, Braden White followed by freshmen and walk-
ons. This group is very thin but if we can avoid major injuries our front 7 will be the 3rd best in the SEC.

### Tight End and Passing Game Production

I guess this section could also be named KELLEN MOND, yeah in all caps. The biggest question of the
whole season to me is number 11 and how he handles the section title above. Last year Jace Sternberger
was a huge part of the passing game. This year we don’t have Jace, and we just lost our 5 star TE to a
season ending injury. How will the passing game be affected? Will we play more 4 WR sets and how will
that affect the run game that led the SEC a year ago? Can Kellen manage the pocket and routinely make
throws outside the hashes to our big receiver group? I don’t know, but if we can get 65% completions,
25 TDs and 5 INTs we could not only surprise some teams this year but be primed for a real run in 2020.
